# Ray Tracing tutorial series

## Introduction

This series of tutorials is meant to walk the reader iteratively through programming a basic ray caster, ray marcher, ray tracer, and path tracer at a beginner level. 
The emphasis will be on simplicity, clarity, and completeness (as far as the beginner level constraint allows), rather than on performance and innovation. 
The goal is to incrementally extend the knowledge of the reader, mainly following the historical development of the field (sphere tracing and ray marching 
being an exception). This means that we will start all the way back with Appel's work on ray casting [#Appel68], take a detour to Hart's paper 
on sphere tracing [#Hart96], proceed through with Whitted's work on ray tracing [#Whitted79], continue with Cook et al.'s 
distributed ray tracing [#Cook84], and finally end our journey with Kajiya's seminal work on the rendering equation and path tracing [#Kajiya86]. 
Other articles and papers would be referenced also, but the ones listed form the foundations for this tutorial series. The order is 
chosen to be conceptually consistent and to follow the increase in complexity of the ideas in the field.
The tutorial comes paired with a C++ implementation of the discussed ideas and techniques. The reader should ideally refer to the code for 
anything missing in the tutorial and vice versa.

## Prerequisites


The reader is expected to have intermediate knowledge in C++ and foundational knowledge from linear algebra and analytic geometry. While 
additional knowledge may help the reader to appreciate some of the ideas better, it is not required, and proofs that go outside of this scope 
may be skipped altogether (they are provided for completeness). Additional proofs/derivations can usually be found in the appendix at the end of 
every tutorial part. The code throughout this tutorial will be in C++, and while we intentionally try to avoid more complex programming notions, 
we still use convenient tools like polymorphism to structure our implementation (while possibly affecting performance). The focus is on 
simplicity and clarity rather than performance. In general the complexity increases with each subsequent part of the tutorial, however, 
most mathematical notions and ideas are distributed throughout the different parts of the tutorial with the intention of keeping 
the learning curve manageable.

## Acknowledgements

I thank Connor Fitzgerald for reviewing the code and making meaningful suggestions how to improve it. 
I also thank Matt Taylor and Michał Witanowski for reviewing the text and offering advice on its structure.
